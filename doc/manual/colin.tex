\chapter{What's Colin?}
\label{cha:colin}

\Colin is an structural analysis application. It's availible under the term of the GNU General Public License\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}}. Unlike most other licenses, the GNU GPL offers you the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [0] the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
	\item [1] the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
	\item [2] the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
	\item [3] the freedom to share the changes you make.
\end{enumerate}\\
The source code of \Colin is availible at clazzes.org. Feel free to explore our SVN\footnote{\url{http://subversion.tigris.org/}} repository at \url{http://svn.clazzes.org/svn/colin/}. Prebuild packages are available for Debian GNU/Linux and Windows. Users of other operation systems can compile it themselves.\\

\Colin is limited to two dimensional structures and an analytical, linear analysis of those. Structures can be statically indeterminate. The following elements can be used to describe the physical structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Nodes} and \textit{Beams} to describe the geometry and physical properties
	\item \textit{Supports}, including springs and rotated supports
	\item \textit{Hinges} of all kind, including springs
	\item \textit{Loads}, including Nodal loads, linear distributed loads, temperature loads
	\item \textit{Basic Load Sets} and \textit{Combined Load Sets}
\end{itemize}\\
Besides, \Colin offers the following additional features for an easy handling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item complete CAD environment
	\item object, grid and orthogonal snap
	\item saving to XML
	\item unlimited undo/redo
	\item copy'n`paste
	\item printing
	\item table like editing in a tree representation
	\item JavaScript Engine including a console
\end{itemize}

I started coding Colin with the aim to create an application which can be used imeadetly after installation. Some advanced features as meterials and cross sections (unused when calculating statically determinated structrues as done a long period at our university), springs as supports or rotated supports, load sets, etc. can be ignored completly and should not disturb.\\
Of course this means also Colin does not contain any stupid, crapy, bullshit-register-here-activate-there-digital-rights-managment\footnote{\url{http://www.defectivebydesign.org/}}. 

\section{getting started on Linux}
\label{sec:startLinux}

If you use a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution, you can use our Debian repository. Debian GNU/Linux based distributions use the *.deb format to install packages. Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint should work with our packages. For distribution witch use *.rpm packages see section~\ref{sec:startOther}.\\

First you need to trust our archiver key. You can do so by opening a terminal and typing:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
wget https://www.clazzes.org/gpg/pba-archiver.clazzes.org.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add - 
\end{lstlisting}
Then you can add our repository to the software sources. To do so, open the \textit{Software Center}. To edit your software sources there, open the \textit{Edit} menu in the menubar and click on \textit{Software  Sources...} there.\\
A new Window should appear. Activate the \textit{Other Software} tab there. Click \textit{Add...} there and enter the following text, depending on your operation systems version:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 or newer and the corresponding Linux Mint
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/ubuntu lucid-colin-1 main  
\end{lstlisting}
	\item Debian Squeeze 6
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/debian squeeze-colin-1 main
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

After updating \textit{apt-get} you should be able to install \Colin.



\section{getting started on Windows}
\label{sec:startWindows}

You can find Windows Setups in our download area at clazzes.org: \url{http://download.clazzes.org/colin/testing/}. *x64* marks the 64 bit version, *x86* the 32 bit version. Download the right version for your Windows. You can install it by executing the Setup. \\

\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Other than on Linux, the Windows version of \Colin does not get updated automatically. Please take look at clazzes.org from time to time to watch out for newer versions of \Colin. Or simply switch to Linux ;)}
\end{center}

\section{getting started on other OS}
\label{sec:startOther}

If you are using an OS for witch no packages are provided, you can download the source from our SVN repository and compile it your self. \Colin should work on most operation systems, including all UNIX like operation systems and OS X. To get \Colin compiled take a look at chapter~\ref{cha:compile}.\\
A version for OS/2 has already been compiled by some else. You can find it at ecomstation.it\footnote{\url{http://www.ecomstation.it/ecsoft2/prog.php?progid=1795&name=Colin&sys=os2+ecomstation}}. Please note that i don't keep this build up-to-date.


\chapter{Objects}
\label{cha:objects}

This chapter gives a quick overview over the objects in \Colin.

\section{Struct}
This object defines structures. It contains all Nodes, Beams, Loads, etc. 

\section{Node}
A Node defines the geometry of structures in \Colin. It contains the coordinates \textit{x} and \textit{z}. Supports can be added to Nodes.

\section{Support}
Supports define the boundary conditions of nodes. Use these to lock the displacement of nodes.

\section{Beam}
These objects represent the beams of the structure. They are spanned between two nodes. Beams contain a reference to their left and right node, their cross section and their material. Besides, hinges can be assigned to beams to define boundary conditions.

\section{Hinge}
Hinges define boundary conditions of beams. 

\section{Loads}
These objects define the load on the structure.

\subsection{Nodal Load}
A simple load on a node.

\subsection{Moment}
A moment on a node.

\subsection{Distributed Loads}
Linear distributed or uniformly distributed loads on beams.

\subsection{Temeperatur Loads}
Loads due to temperature changes or temperature differences.
 
\subsection{Double Load} 
Loads between the left and right side of a hinge.

\section{Basic Load Set}
Loads can be assigned to Basic Load Sets (BLS) to group them.

\section{Combined Load Set}
Combine groups of loads for the calculation of many cases in once.

\section{Material}
The material defines material properties of beams, \textit{stiffness} E and \textit{thermal expansion coefficient} $\alpha_T$.

\section{Cross Section}
Cross Sections define the geometry of beams in their local y-z plane,  \textit{height} h, \textit{area} A and \textit{second moment of area} I.

\chapter{Graphical User Interface}

This chapter gives an overview over the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Colin.

\section{Workspace}
\label{sec:workspace}

Here a quick overview over the Workspace. This is the part of the GUI you are actually working with. The different parts are explained in depth later.

\end{itemize}

\section{Menubar}
\label{sec:menubar}
The menubar is placed on top of the Mainwindow on most operation systems. The \textit{file} menu contains some basic actions to organize, such as \textit{open} and \textit{save} (see figure~\ref{pic:filemenu}). The \texitit{edit} menu contains some additional actions to manipulate the current file (see figure~\ref{pic:editmenu}) which are not present in the toolbar (see section~\ref{sec:toolbar}. You can activate these action by pressing the shortcut. It's visible next to the corresponding action.

\begin{minipage}[b]{\textwidth/2}

	\item \textit{settings}: launces the settings page.
\end{itemize}
\section{Tabbar}
\label{sec:tabbar}
This bar can be found on the buttom of the Colin GUI. You can see all open files and active them by clicking on them. Press the cross to close a tab. Press "+" to open a new tab.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pictures/tabbar.png}
\caption{tabbar}
\label{pic:tabbar}
\end{figure}

\section{Toolbar}
\label{sec:toolbar}

The toolbar contains the most used actions. Icons with a triangle besides them are expandable. You can trigger a menu with more options by keeping the button pressed long. When moving the mouse over a icon a tooltip with some basic informations of the usage appears. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pictures/toolbar.png}
\caption{toolbar}
\label{pic:toolbar}
\end{figure}

Here the actions in the toolbar from left to right.
\subsection{Nodes}
When activated, you can draw Nodes by clicking on the designated position in the GraphicsView. When you click on a beam, the beam gets spitted at the clicked position, when clicking on 2 crossing beams, the get both splitted and connected with a new node.

\subsection{Beams}
When activated, you can draw Beams, by clicking on the designated nodes in the GraphicView. If you do not click on a node, a new node will be created. Material and cross section are chosen automatically. You can set the material and cross section of beams created like this in the library widget (see section~\ref{ssec:library}). You can edit them afterwards too. This is shown in section~\ref{sec:graphical} (by using the GraphicView) and in section~\ref{ssec:tree} (by using the tree representation).

\subsection{Supports}
\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./pictures/support_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:support_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can add supports to nodes by clicking on the in the GraphicsView. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more settings. The buttons as shown in figure~\ref{pic:support_opt} appear. Here you can set the basic form of the support which gets added to a nodes by clicking on them:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingH.png} horizontal support: the horizontal displacement will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearing.png} vertical support: the vertical displacement of the node will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingM.png} rotational support: the rotation of the node will be zero
\end{trivlist}
You can choose any combination of these 3 basic supports. To use springs as supports and for rotated supports see section~\ref{ssec:tree}.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Hinges}

\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./pictures/hinge_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:hinge_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can add hinges to beams. Click on a beam to add a hinge at the designated position of the beam. Click near the left or right node of a beam to put the hinge to the right or left end of the beam. Keep the button pressed to get access to more settings. You can choose the the type of hinge by clicking on the respective button:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/jointN.png} normal force on the respective position will be zero.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/jointQ.png} shear force on the respective position will be zero.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/joint.png} moment on the respective position will be zero.
\end{trivlist}
If you want a sprint between the left and right side of a hinge take a look in section~\ref{ssec:tree}.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Loads}

\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./pictures/load_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:load_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated you can add loads to the structure. Most of the actions here need two clicks to create a load. Figure~\ref{pic:drawload} shows the two required clicks for an uniformly distributed load. Keep the button pressed to get access to more settings. The possible types of loads:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} nodal lode. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/moment.png} moment. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the moment. The second click sets the value $M$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ustload.png} uniformly distributed load. Click on a beam to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/istload.png} increasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/dstload.png} decreasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/temp.png} temperature load. Click on a beam to specify the designated position of the temperature load. The widget as shown in figure~\ref{pic:tempwidget} in form of a thermometer appears. You can switch between temperature change and temperature difference (between top and bottom of the cross section) by clicking the button besides the thermometer or pressing the left and right keys ($\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$) on your keyboard. You can set the temperature difference by clicking on the thermometer (the scale is adapted automatically) or with the up and down keys ($\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$) of your keyboard. \textbf{Complete the input with the \textit{Enter} key.}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/doubleL.png} double loads between the left and right side of a hinge.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
This button offers some options for the snap function of the GraphicsView (see section~\ref{sec:graphical}). You should know snap from other CAD applications. The snap tool can be enabled or disabled with a short click. For some actions, for which the snap function is required as adding supports or loads to the structure, the snap is always active. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more options. You can enable and disable specific snap functions by clicking on the related button.
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} Grid: If near the grid, the mouse gets snaped an moved to the grid. Also, when drawing a load or a beam with actived grid snap, the snap helps to enter beams with rounded lengths and rounded loads.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} Node: Snap nodes while drawing beams. This option must be on to connect existing nodes. When turned of, a click near a node will create a new node.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/crossing.png}Intersecting beams: When active, you will be able to snap the intersection of two beams. This allows to draw nodes in the position where the beams are intersecting. The intersecting beams will be connected to the new node when you do so.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/middle.png} Middle of beams: When active, the snap helps you to split beams in two sections with the same length while drawing nodes or beams. Also node loads can be put on beams (a new node is created automatically). With this option the middle of a beam is prefered.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/beam.png} Beams: While drawing nodes or beams, positions on beams are prefered. The beam snaped is connected to created nodes.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ortho_g.png} Global orthogonal: When enabled, the snap helps you to draw horizontal and vertical beams and loads.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ortho_l.png} Local orthogonal: When activated, the snap helps you to draw beams normal or parallel to existing beams. While drawing loads, the snap helps you to draw loads normal or parallel to the beam where the load is put on.
	\item[] \textbf{[range]}: The slider on the right side of the buttons can be used to adjust the range which the snap interprets as "near".

After a click on the window tool button the menu in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar} appears. You can see three menu entrys:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{fullscreen}: Switch fullscreen mode on and off.
	\item \textit{show all}: Show all GraphicViews.
	\item \textit{show sidebar}: Hide and show the sidebar.
\end{itemize}
The four rectangles in this menu can be used to chose the visilbe GraphicViews. The GraphicViews are explaned in depth in section~\ref{sec:graphical}. You can click on a single rectangle to show the related GraphicsView. The currently visilbe GraphicViews are highlighted as the GraphicsView on the button left in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2}. The notations whitin the rectangles shows the data visulized in the related GraphicsView. You can also select more of them as shown in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2}. To do so, click on a Point in the area. A rectangle appears. Keep the mouse pressed and move the mouse until the rectanlge covers all GraphicViews you want to be shown. After releasing the mousebutton, a selection as in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2} would show the two GraphicsViews on the top.

\section{Settings}
\label{sec:settings}
Here you find all the settings. You can reach this page from the startpage, the menu (\textit{edit} $\rightarrow$ \textit{settings}) or the corresponding shortcut (Ctrl+Space). This page is divided in three pages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item color settings
	\item shortcut settings
	\item miscellaneous settings
\end{itemize}\\
You can access the pages using the buttons on top of this page. Restore the settings which \Colin has at the beginning by pressing the Button \textit{restore settings}.

\chapter{Valgrind hints}
\label{cha:valgrind}
Valgrind is memory check tool and threading check tool for Unix. It detects memory leaks, uninitialized memory, corrupt reads and writes on memory, running conditions, dead locks etc.\footnote{\url{http://valgrind.org/}}\\
You should find a valgrind package in your distributors repository. On a Debian based Linux you can install it by typing the following in a terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
sudo apt-get install valgrind
\end{lstlisting}

You than can run valgrind as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

To remove warnings detected in libraries such as Qt, add suppression files to the valgrind parameters. The valgrind folder in the SVN repository contains a bash script to download the supression file for the gnome environment. Run the following in the valgrind folder to get it:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
./get_supp.sh
\end{lstlisting}

Run valgrind afterwards as follows in the Debug folder:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=../valgrind/libh3dtoolkit.supp ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

You can add warnings to the supression file if you are sure they do not affect the right execution application.
