\chapter{What's Colin?}
\label{cha:colin}

\Colin is an structural analysis application. It's availible under the term of the GNU General Public License\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}}. Unlike most other licenses, the GNU GPL offers you the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [0] the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
	\item [1] the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
	\item [2] the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
	\item [3] the freedom to share the changes you make.
\end{enumerate}\\
The source code of \Colin is availible at clazzes.org. Feel free to explore our SVN\footnote{\url{http://subversion.tigris.org/}} repository at \url{http://svn.clazzes.org/svn/colin/}. Prebuild packages are available for Debian GNU/Linux and Windows. Users of other operation systems can compile it themselves.\\

\Colin is limited to two dimensional structures and an analytical, linear analysis of those. Structures can be statically indeterminate. The following elements can be used to describe the physical structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Nodes} and \textit{Beams} to describe the geometry and physical properties
	\item \textit{Supports}, including springs and rotated supports
	\item \textit{Hinges} of all kind, including springs
	\item \textit{Loads}, including Nodal loads, linear distributed loads, temperature loads
	\item \textit{Basic Load Sets} and \textit{Combined Load Sets}
\end{itemize}\\
Besides, \Colin offers the following additional features for an easy handling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item complete CAD environment
	\item object, grid and orthogonal snap
	\item saving to XML
	\item unlimited undo/redo
	\item copy'n`paste
	\item printing
	\item table like editing in a tree representation
	\item JavaScript Engine including a console
\end{itemize}

I started coding Colin with the aim to create an application which can be used imeadetly after installation. Some advanced features as meterials and cross sections (unused when calculating statically determinated structrues as done a long period at our university), springs as supports or rotated supports, load sets, etc. can be ignored completly and should not disturb.\\
Of course this means also Colin does not contain any stupid, crapy, bullshit-register-here-activate-there-digital-rights-managment\footnote{\url{http://www.defectivebydesign.org/}}. 


\section{getting started on Linux}
\label{sec:startLinux}

If you use a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution, you can use our Debian repository. Debian GNU/Linux based distributions use the *.deb format to install packages. Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint should work with our packages. For distribution witch use *.rpm packages see section~\ref{sec:startOther}.\\

First you need to trust our archiver key. You can do so by opening a terminal and typing:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
wget https://www.clazzes.org/gpg/pba-archiver.clazzes.org.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add - 
\end{lstlisting}
Then you can add our repository to the software sources. To do so, open the \textit{Software Center}. To edit your software sources there, open the \textit{Edit} menu in the menubar and click on \textit{Software  Sources...} there.\\
A new Window should appear. Activate the \textit{Other Software} tab there. Click \textit{Add...} there and enter the following text, depending on your operation systems version:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 or newer and the corresponding Linux Mint
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/ubuntu lucid-colin-1 main  
\end{lstlisting}
	\item Debian Squeeze 6
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/debian squeeze-colin-1 main
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

After updating \textit{apt-get} you should be able to install \Colin.



\section{getting started on Windows}
\label{sec:startWindows}

You can find Windows Setups in our download area at clazzes.org: \url{http://download.clazzes.org/colin/testing/}. *x64* marks the 64 bit version, *x86* the 32 bit version. Download the right version for your Windows. You can install it by executing the Setup. \\

\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Other than on Linux, the Windows version of \Colin does not get updated automatically. Please take look at clazzes.org from time to time to watch out for newer versions of \Colin. Or simply switch to Linux ;)}
\end{center}

\section{getting started on other OS}
\label{sec:startOther}

If you are using an OS for witch no packages are provided, you can download the source from our SVN repository and compile it your self. \Colin should work on most operation systems, including all UNIX like operation systems and OS X. To get \Colin compiled take a look at chapter~\ref{cha:compile}.\\
A version for OS/2 has already been compiled by some else. You can find it at ecomstation.it\footnote{\url{http://www.ecomstation.it/ecsoft2/prog.php?progid=1795&name=Colin&sys=os2+ecomstation}}. Please note that i don't keep this build up-to-date.


\chapter{Objects}
\label{cha:objects}

This chapter gives a quick overview over the objects in \Colin.

\section{Struct}
This object defines structures. It contains all Nodes, Beams, Loads, etc. 

\section{Node}
A Node defines the geometry of structures in \Colin. It contains the coordinates \textit{x} and \textit{z}. Supports can be added to Nodes.

\section{Support}
Supports define the boundary conditions of nodes. Use these to lock the displacement of nodes.

\section{Beam}
These objects represent the beams of the structure. They are spanned between two nodes. Beams contain a reference to their left and right node, their cross section and their material. Besides, hinges can be assigned to beams to define boundary conditions.

\section{Hinge}
Hinges define boundary conditions of beams. 

\section{Loads}
These objects define the load on the structure.

\subsection{Nodal Load}
A simple load on a node.

\subsection{Moment}
A moment on a node.

\subsection{Distributed Loads}
Linear distributed or uniformly distributed loads on beams.

\subsection{Temeperatur Loads}
Loads due to temperature changes or temperature differences.
 
\subsection{Double Load} 
Loads between the left and right side of a hinge.

\section{Basic Load Set}
Loads can be assigned to Basic Load Sets (BLS) to group them.

\section{Combined Load Set}
Combine groups of loads for the calculation of many cases in once.

\section{Material}
The material defines material properties of beams, \textit{stiffness} E and \textit{thermal expansion coefficient} $\alpha_T$.

\section{Cross Section}
Cross Sections define the geometry of beams in their local y-z plane,  \textit{height} h, \textit{area} A and \textit{second moment of area} I.

\chapter{Graphical User Interface}

This chapter gives an overview over the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Colin.

\section{Workspace}
\label{sec:workspace}

Here a quick overview over the Workspace. This is the part of the GUI you are actually working with. The different parts are explained in depth later.

	\item Tabbar: Shows the opened files. See section~\ref{sec:tabbar}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Menubar}
\label{sec:menubar}
The menubar is placed on top of the Mainwindow on most operation systems. The \textit{file} menu contains some basic actions to organize, such as \textit{open} and \textit{save} (see figure~\ref{pic:filemenu}). The \textit{edit} menu contains some additional actions to manipulate the current file (see figure~\ref{pic:editmenu}) which are not present in the toolbar (see section~\ref{sec:toolbar}. You can activate these action by pressing the shortcut. It's visible next to the corresponding action.

\begin{minipage}[b]{\textwidth/2}

	\item \textit{settings}: launces the settings page.
\end{itemize}
\section{Tabbar}
\label{sec:tabbar}
This bar can be found on the buttom of the Colin GUI. You can see all open files and active them by clicking on them. Press the cross to close a tab. Press "+" to open a new tab.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/tabbar.png}
\caption{tabbar}
\label{pic:tabbar}
\end{figure}

\section{Toolbar}
\label{sec:toolbar}

The toolbar contains the most used actions. Icons with a triangle besides them are expandable. You can trigger a menu with more options by keeping the button pressed long. When moving the mouse over a icon a tooltip with some basic informations of the usage appears. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/toolbar.png}
\caption{toolbar}
\label{pic:toolbar}
\end{figure}

Here the actions in the toolbar from left to right.
\subsection{Nodes}
When activated, you can draw Nodes by clicking on the designated position in the GraphicsView. When you click on a beam, the beam gets spitted at the clicked position, when clicking on 2 crossing beams, the get both splitted and connected with a new node.

\subsection{Beams}
When activated, you can draw Beams, by clicking on the designated nodes in the GraphicView. If you do not click on a node, a new node will be created. Material and cross section are chosen automatically. You can set the material and cross section of beams created like this in the library widget (see section~\ref{ssec:library}). You can edit them afterwards too. This is shown in section~\ref{sec:graphical} (by using the GraphicView) and in section~\ref{ssec:tree} (by using the tree representation).

\subsection{Supports}
\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/support_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:support_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can add supports to nodes by clicking on the in the GraphicsView. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more settings. The buttons as shown in figure~\ref{pic:support_opt} appear. Here you can set the basic form of the support which gets added to a nodes by clicking on them:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingH.png} horizontal support: the horizontal displacement will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearing.png} vertical support: the vertical displacement of the node will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingM.png} rotational support: the rotation of the node will be zero
\end{trivlist}
You can choose any combination of these 3 basic supports. To use springs as supports and for rotated supports see section~\ref{ssec:tree}.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Hinges}

\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/hinge_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:hinge_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can add hinges to beams. Click on a beam to add a hinge at the designated position of the beam. Click near the left or right node of a beam to put the hinge to the right or left end of the beam. Keep the button pressed to get access to more settings. You can choose the the type of hinge by clicking on the respective button:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/jointN.png} normal force on the respective position will be zero.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/jointQ.png} shear force on the respective position will be zero.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/joint.png} moment on the respective position will be zero.
\end{trivlist}
If you want a sprint between the left and right side of a hinge take a look in section~\ref{ssec:tree}.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Loads}

\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/load_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:load_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated you can add loads to the structure. Most of the actions here need two clicks to create a load. Figure~\ref{pic:drawload} shows the two required clicks for an uniformly distributed load. Keep the button pressed to get access to more settings. The possible types of loads:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} nodal lode. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/moment.png} moment. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the moment. The second click sets the value $M$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ustload.png} uniformly distributed load. Click on a beam to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/istload.png} increasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/dstload.png} decreasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/temp.png} temperature load. Click on a beam to specify the designated position of the temperature load. The widget as shown in figure~\ref{pic:tempwidget} in form of a thermometer appears. You can switch between temperature change and temperature difference (between top and bottom of the cross section) by clicking the button besides the thermometer or pressing the left and right keys ($\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$) on your keyboard. You can set the temperature difference by clicking on the thermometer (the scale is adapted automatically) or with the up and down keys ($\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$) of your keyboard. \textbf{Complete the input with the \textit{Enter} key.}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/doubleL.png} double loads between the left and right side of a hinge.

\label{pic:snap_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
This button offers some options for the snap function of the GraphicsView (see section~\ref{sec:graphical}). You should know snap from other CAD applications. The snap tool can be enabled or disabled with a short click. For some actions, for which the snap function is required as adding supports or loads to the structure, the snap is always active. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more options. You can enable and disable specific snap functions by clicking on the related button.
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} Grid: If near the grid, the mouse gets snaped an moved to the grid. Also, when drawing a load or a beam with actived grid snap, the snap helps to enter beams with rounded lengths and rounded loads.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} Node: Snap nodes while drawing beams. This option must be on to connect existing nodes. When turned of, a click near a node will create a new node.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/crossing.png}Intersecting beams: When active, you will be able to snap the intersection of two beams. This allows to draw nodes in the position where the beams are intersecting. The intersecting beams will be connected to the new node when you do so.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/middle.png} Middle of beams: When active, the snap helps you to split beams in two sections with the same length while drawing nodes or beams.

\subsection{Right Click Widgets}
\label{sec:rightclickwidgets}

A right click will show you a widget with more information about the item clicked. Depending on the item clicked, one of the following widgets will appear:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} \textbf{background}: A widget for overall inforamtion, see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}.

This view appears after a \textbf{right click} on the background of the view widget. It shows some basic overall information. 

\paragraph{paste}
This element (placed on the left side of the screen, see also figure~\ref{pic:generaloverlay}) shows an overview over all parts which have been copied by any instance of \Colin. This can be nodes (with the corresponding support), beams (with the corresponding nodes and their properties), loads (including their basic load set) or many items. You can remove them from the temporary memory by clicking on the red cross in the upper right corner of the preview. You can insert them to your current file by clicking on the preview. This view will disappear immediately to allow you to specify the position where the copied elements should be insert. Click on the designated position to finish the procedure. The copied parts are now part of your current file. 

\paragraph{export}
This element (placed in the middle of the screen, see also figure~\ref{pic:generaloverlay}) allows you to export a picture of your current view on the structure. The picture contains the same elements and functions as the view you picked to launch this menu. The zoomfactor of all loads and functions matches also to those in the viewports.
The picture on top shows a preview of the exported file. Below, you can set some properties to make sure the picture matched to your needs:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{left}: The left boundary of the rectangle which is exported in global coordinates (meters).
	\item[]\textbf{right}: The right boundary of the rectangle which is exported in global coordinates (meters).

This view appears after a \textbf{right click} on a node. It shows all properties of the node and allows edition (left row). Also, this view offers a detailed view to results for this node (center and right row).

\paragraph{coordinates}
Set the coordinates of the node:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{x}: horizontal coordinate of the node in meters
	\item[]\textbf{z}: vertical coordinate of the node in meters
	\item[]\textbf{phi}: the angle of the local coordinate system of the node. Editing is disabled if no support is set for this node. The local coordinate system affects only nodes with supports. Counterclockwise angles are positive!
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{support}
The first three buttons allow to set the support for this note:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm

You can also set springs by checking the \textif{springs} ckeckbox. An extended toolbox as in figure~\ref{pic:supportextended} appears. To add a spring to your node, press the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} button next to the designated direction. The textbox next to the button will be activated and allow entering of a spring constant. The unit is shown at the end of the row (it can be set in the settings part, see also section~\ref{ssec:miscsettings}) 
\end{minipage}


\paragraph{clipboard}
Use the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} \textit{copy} or \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} \textit{cut} button to copy the current node to the clipboard. The support gets copied too. Therefore, this feature can be used to assign supports very quickly to your nodes.

\paragraph{view}
Shows a detailed view on the current node. Colors are the same as in the viewport. Beside reaction forces, the graphic shows all forces in beams connected to this node. If you are using load set and combined load sets, the same CLS as in the viewport are shown here.

\paragraph{displacement}
Shows the displacement of the node. If you are using load sets and the value is the zero for all load sets, only one value is shown (labeled with $_{\max}$). Otherwise, all values are shown, below the maximum absolute value (labeled with $_{\max}$).
\textbf{You can select this text and copy it to your clipboard!} The index in the notation is the index of the CLS which leads to the respective displacement (for example, $u_{\max} = \text{absolute maximum of horizontal displacement}$, $u_{i} = \text{horizontal displacement of CLS i}$).

\paragraph{reactions}
Shows the reaction forces of the node. As for the displacement, the absolute maximum is shown on the top. Also, only one value is shown if all reaction forces of this direction are zero. They will not be listed if there is no support for the respective degree of freedom. Of course, this text can be copied to clipboard too.

\paragraph{beam forces}
Lists the forces in all beams connected to the note at the position where it is connected to the note. Only minimal and maximum value are shown if you are using CLS. Can also be copied.

\end{trivlist}


All values can also be edited by clicking on them and entering the designated value.\\

\paragraph{Organization}

The tree contains 5 top level entries. All of them can be expanded to show their respective items. Some underlying entries can by expanded as well by clicking on the triangle on the left side.\\

Some entries are also marked with a green plus. This indicated that this entry can be used to add new items to the structure.


\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} \textbf{nodes}: Contains all nodes. Each row shows one node, the last row shows a void entry which can be used to add nodes to the structure. A new node is added to the structure, when the coordinates have been set. All other properties can be set afterwards. Each column shows on the following properties:
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[]\textbf{x}: shows the x coordinate of the node
		\item[]\textbf{z}: shows the z coordinate of the node
		\item[]\textbf{phi}: shows the angle of the local coordinate system of the node. A node has only a local coordinate system if a support is set for the node.
	\end{trivlist}
	node entrys can be expanded to show: 
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearing.png} \textbf{supports}: Each column shows one of the following:
		\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=2cm
		\item[]\textbf{x}: shows the support of the node in x direction. This value can be \textit{free} or \textit{locked}. Also, you can add a numeric value to force \colin to add a spring as support to this node. The sprin constand will be the entered value.
		\item[]\textbf{z}: shows the support of the node in y direction. Same usage as for x direction.
		\item[]\textbf{phi}: shows the support of the node against rotation. Same usage as for x direction.
		\end{trivlist}
	\end{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/beam.png} \textbf{beams}: Contains all beams. Each row shows one beam, the last row shows a void entry which can be used to add beams. A new beam is added to the structure, when the nodes which define it's geometry have been set. All other properties can be set afterwards. Each column shows one of the following properties:
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm		
		\item[]\textbf{from}: the left node of the beam
		\item[]\textbf{to}: the right node of the beam
		\item[]\textbf{material}: the material of the beam. Can be chosen in a list when clicking on the parameter

	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bls.png} \textbf{parts of CLS}: Each of them represents a BLS added to this CLS, one per row. Data in columns shows one of the following:
		\begin{trivlist}
			\leftskip=2cm
			\item[]\textbf{name}: the name of the BLS added to this CLS. After a click on a name, a list with all BLS appers. Select one of them to replace the BLS. Select \textit{delete} to remove this entry from your combination. Also a right click on an item enables you to remove the BLS from the combination.
			\item[]\textbf{active/factor}: All loads of the BLS are multiplied with the factor when calculating forces in the structure.
		\end{trivlist}
		To add a BLS to the combination, use the last row, marked with a green plus. Once you entered a name, the load set is added with factor one to the combination. Of course this factor can be changed afterwards. If you enter a name witch already exists, a number is appended to the name.

Valgrind is memory check tool and threading check tool for Unix. It detects memory leaks, uninitialized memory, corrupt reads and writes on memory, running conditions, dead locks etc.\footnote{\url{http://valgrind.org/}}\\
You should find a valgrind package in your distributors repository. On a Debian based Linux you can install it by typing the following in a terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
sudo apt-get install valgrind
\end{lstlisting}

You than can run valgrind as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

To remove warnings detected in libraries such as Qt, add suppression files to the valgrind parameters. The valgrind folder in the SVN repository contains a bash script to download the supression file for the gnome environment. Run the following in the valgrind folder to get it:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
./get_supp.sh
\end{lstlisting}

Run valgrind afterwards as follows in the Debug folder:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=../valgrind/libh3dtoolkit.supp ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

You can add warnings to the supression file if you are sure they do not affect the correct execution application.
