\chapter{What's Colin?}
\label{cha:colin}

\Colin is an structural analysis application. It's availible under the term of the GNU General Public License\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}}. Unlike most other licenses, the GNU GPL offers you the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [0] the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
	\item [1] the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
	\item [2] the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
	\item [3] the freedom to share the changes you make.
\end{enumerate}\\
The source code of \Colin is availible at clazzes.org. Feel free to explore our SVN\footnote{\url{http://subversion.tigris.org/}} repository at \url{http://svn.clazzes.org/svn/colin/}. Prebuild packages are available for Debian GNU/Linux and Windows. Users of other operation systems can compile it themselves.\\

\Colin is limited to two dimensional structures and an analytical, linear analysis of those. Structures can be statically indeterminate. The following elements can be used to describe the physical structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Nodes} and \textit{Beams} to describe the geometry and physical properties
	\item \textit{Supports}, including springs and rotated supports
	\item \textit{Hinges} of all kind, including springs
	\item \textit{Loads}, including Nodal loads, linear distributed loads, temperature loads
	\item \textit{Basic Load Sets} and \textit{Combined Load Sets}
\end{itemize}\\
Besides, \Colin offers the following additional features for an easy handling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item complete CAD environment
	\item object, grid and orthogonal snap
	\item saving to XML
	\item unlimited undo/redo
	\item copy'n`paste
	\item printing
	\item table like editing in a tree representation
	\item JavaScript Engine including a console
\end{itemize}

I started coding Colin with the aim to create an application which can be used imeadetly after installation. Some advanced features as meterials and cross sections (unused when calculating statically determinated structrues as done a long period at our university), springs as supports or rotated supports, load sets, etc. can be ignored completly and should not disturb.\\
Of course this means also Colin does not contain any stupid, crapy, bullshit-register-here-activate-there-digital-rights-managment\footnote{\url{http://www.defectivebydesign.org/}}. 


\section{getting started on Linux}
\label{sec:startLinux}

If you use a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution, you can use our Debian repository. Debian GNU/Linux based distributions use the *.deb format to install packages. Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint should work with our packages. For distribution witch use *.rpm packages see section~\ref{sec:startOther}.\\

First you need to trust our archiver key. You can do so by opening a terminal and typing:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
wget https://www.clazzes.org/gpg/pba-archiver.clazzes.org.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add - 
\end{lstlisting}
Then you can add our repository to the software sources. To do so, open the \textit{Software Center}. To edit your software sources there, open the \textit{Edit} menu in the menubar and click on \textit{Software  Sources...} there.\\
A new Window should appear. Activate the \textit{Other Software} tab there. Click \textit{Add...} there and enter the following text, depending on your operation systems version:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 or newer and the corresponding Linux Mint
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/ubuntu lucid-colin-1 main  
\end{lstlisting}
	\item Debian Squeeze 6
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
deb http://deb.clazzes.org/debian squeeze-colin-1 main
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

After updating \textit{apt-get} you should be able to install \Colin.



\section{getting started on Windows}
\label{sec:startWindows}

You can find Windows Setups in our download area at clazzes.org: \url{http://download.clazzes.org/colin/testing/}. *x64* marks the 64 bit version, *x86* the 32 bit version. Download the right version for your Windows. You can install it by executing the Setup. \\

\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Other than on Linux, the Windows version of \Colin does not get updated automatically. Please take look at clazzes.org from time to time to watch out for newer versions of \Colin. Or simply switch to Linux ;)}
\end{center}

\section{getting started on other OS}
\label{sec:startOther}

If you are using an OS for witch no packages are provided, you can download the source from our SVN repository and compile it your self. \Colin should work on most operation systems, including all UNIX like operation systems and OS X. To get \Colin compiled take a look at chapter~\ref{cha:compile}.\\
A version for OS/2 has already been compiled by some else. You can find it at ecomstation.it\footnote{\url{http://www.ecomstation.it/ecsoft2/prog.php?progid=1795&name=Colin&sys=os2+ecomstation}}. Please note that i don't keep this build up-to-date.


\chapter{Objects and Basic Definitions}
\label{cha:objects}

This chapter gives a quick overview over the objects in \Colin and basic definitions you might want to know about!




\section{Struct}
This object defines structures. It contains all Nodes, Beams, Loads, etc. 

\section{Node}
A Node defines the geometry of structures in \Colin. It contains the coordinates \textit{x} and \textit{z}. Supports can be added to Nodes.

\section{Support}
Supports define the boundary conditions of nodes. Use these to lock the displacement of nodes.

\section{Beam}
These objects represent the beams of the structure. They are spanned between two nodes. Beams contain a reference to their left and right node, their cross section and their material. Besides, hinges can be assigned to beams to define boundary conditions.

\section{Hinge}
Hinges define boundary conditions of beams. 

\section{Loads}
These objects define the load on the structure.

\subsection{Nodal Load}
A simple load on a node.

\subsection{Moment}
A moment on a node.

\subsection{Distributed Loads}
Linear distributed or uniformly distributed loads on beams.

\subsection{Temeperatur Loads}
Loads due to temperature changes or temperature differences.
 
\subsection{Double Load} 
Loads between the left and right side of a hinge.

\section{Basic Load Set}
Loads can be assigned to Basic Load Sets (BLS) to group them.

\section{Combined Load Set}
Combine groups of loads for the calculation of many cases in once.

\section{Material}
The material defines material properties of beams, \textit{stiffness} E and \textit{thermal expansion coefficient} $\alpha_T$.

\section{Cross Section}
Cross Sections define the geometry of beams in their local y-z plane,  \textit{height} h, \textit{area} A and \textit{second moment of area} I.


\section{Coordinate system}
\subsection{global coordinate system (GCS)}
\begin{minipage}[h]{6.5cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/coordsys.png}
\caption{Coordinate system in \Colin}
\label{pic:coordsystem}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-7.5cm}
\Colin can handle two dimensional structures. Figure~\ref{pic:coordsystem} shows the x axis (horizontal dimension) in green, the z axis (vertical dimension) in red and the orientation of a positive angle in blue of the Cartesian coordinate system. As you can see, a positive angle is rotating counterclockwise, this is the same for every angle related value in \Colin such as moments, rotations entered by the user and resulting rotations\footnotemark. The unit for length is \textit{meter}, the unit for angles is \textit{grad} $[^\circ]$ ($180^\circ = \pi \cdot \text{rad}$) \footnotemark. 
\end{minipage}
\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}
\footnotetext{Except coil spring constants. We are using rad instead of grad, because of the homework at our university!;)}
\stepcounter{footnote}
\footnotetext{Internally this is actually handled otherwise. A clockwise angle is internally represented as a negative value. Also, the unit used internally is \textit{rad}. This was chosen due to definitions in the Qt framwork and the mathematik library.}

\subsection{local coordinate system (LCS)}

\begin{minipage}[h]{6.5cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/localsys_raw.png}
\caption{local coordinate system}
\label{pic:localcoordsystem}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-7.5cm}
The local coordinate system of a beam is shown in figure~\ref{pic:localcoordsystem}. The center of the local coordinate system of a beam is placed in it's left node. The beam axis is the local x axis, the z axis is normal to the x axis. Positive angles and moments are orientated the same as in the global coordinate system. All results will be drawn as x-z pairs in the local coordinate system. Also nodes might have a local coordinate system. This has been implemented to allow usage of rotated springs. This does not affect any results or loads related to this node(always given in global coordinates).
\end{minipage}


\subsection{coordinate system of results}
The results are displayed and listed as follows:

\paragraph{reaction forces} follows form the load or constraint due to temperature changes. will always be displayed and listed in the global coordinate system, even if the node has been rotated (see figure~\ref{pic:reactionrotated})!. Since reactions exist in the same coordinate system as loads, a positive load or moment will lead to a negative reaction force or reaction moment!



\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/reactionforce.png}
\caption{positive force and reaction}
\label{pic:reactionforce}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/reactionmoment.png}
\caption{positive moment and reaction}
\label{pic:reactionmoment}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/reactionrotated.png}
\caption{rotated node and reaction}
\label{pic:reactionrotated}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}


\paragraph{nodal displacement} follows form the load or temperature changes. will always be displayed and listed in the global coordinate system in meter, even if the node has been rotated and has a local coordinate system!. The nodal displacement will be listed in form of three values:
\begin{align*}
u &\dots \text{displacement in x direction}\\
w &\dots \text{displacement in z direction}\\
\varphi &\dots \text{rotation}
\end{align*}
To display the displacement, it is multiplied with a factor $s_u$ because it will be mostly (hopefully ;) ) be much more smaller than the dimensions of your structure. This leads to a deformed position in figures as follows:
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{r} x_d\\ y_d \end{array} \right) &= s_u \cdot \left(\begin{array}{r} u\\ w \end{array} \right) + \left(\begin{array}{r} x \\ y \end{array}\right)
\end{align}
with
\begin{align*}
x_d, y_d &\dots \text{position of the node in deformed configuration}\\
s_u &\dots \text{scaling for displacement}\\
x, y &\dots \text{coordinates of the left node in reference configuration}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{beam forces} will always be displayed in the local coordinate system of the beam as shown in figures \ref{pic:normalbeamforce}, \ref{pic:shearbeamforce} and \ref{pic:momentbeamforce}.


\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/normalforceresults.png}
\caption{normal forces in the beam}
\label{pic:normalbeamforce}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/shearforcesresults.png}
\caption{shear forces in the beam}
\label{pic:shearbeamforce}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/momentsresults.png}
\caption{moments in the beam}
\label{pic:momentbeamforce}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}

The conversation from the local coordinate system to the figures global coordinate system is done by

\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{r} x_f(x)\\ y_f(x) \end{array} \right) &= \left[\begin{array}{rr} \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\ \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\end{array}\right] \cdot \left( s_{P/M} \cdot  \left(\begin{array}{r} 0 \\ f(x) \end{array}\right) + \left(\begin{array}{r} x \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \right) + \left(\begin{array}{r} x_l \\ y_l \end{array}\right)
\end{align}
with
\begin{align*}
x &\dots \text{x coordinate in LCS}\\
x_f(x), y_f(x) &\dots \text{a point of the function as appearing in the figure}\\
f(x) &\dots \text{function depending on local x}\\
s_{P/M} &\dots \text{scaling for forces $s_P$ or moments $s_M$}\\
\alpha &\dots \text{angle of the beam}\\
x_l, y_l &\dots \text{coordinates of the left node (center of the local coordinate system)}
\end{align*}


\paragraph{beam displacement} will be expressed in form of the three functions:
\begin{align*}
u(x) &\dots \text{displacement in local x direction at position x}\\
w(x) &\dots \text{displacement in local z direction at position x}\\
\varphi(x) &\dots \text{rotation at position x}
\end{align*}
The deformed beam is shown in form of the bending line (see figure~\ref{pic:beningline}). This leads to the following function for the visualized of the deformed beam:

\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{r} x_d(x)\\ y_d(x) \end{array} \right) &= \left[\begin{array}{rr} \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\ \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\end{array}\right] \cdot \left( s_u \cdot \vec{u}_\text{local}(x) + \left(\begin{array}{r} x \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \right) + \left(\begin{array}{r} x_l \\ y_l \end{array}\right)
\end{align}
with
\begin{align*}
x &\dots \text{x coordinate in LCS}\\
x_d(x), y_d(x) &\dots \text{position of the deformed beam (bening line) in the figure for beam position x}\\
\vec{u}_\text{local}(x) &\dots \text{function for displacement in local coodinate system}\\
s_u &\dots \text{scaling for displacement}\\
\alpha &\dots \text{angle of the beam}\\
x_l, y_l &\dots \text{coordinates of the left node (center of the local coordinate system)}
\end{align*}

The functions you will see for the displacement is actually the local displacement 
\section{Units}

Here are the most common used units in \Colin. Some of them can be changed (see section~\ref{ssec:miscsettings}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item [] \textbf{length}: meter [m]
	\item [] \textbf{angle}: grad [$^\circ$]
	\item [] \textbf{temperature}: kelvin [K]

	\item [] \textbf{coil springs constant}: newton per \textbf{radiant} $\left[\frac{Nm}{rad}\right]$, kilo newton per \textbf{radiant} $\left[\frac{kNm}{rad}\right]$
	
\end{itemize}


\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Internally \Colin uses always the SI units meter, newton and kelvin and rad for angles. This units will also be used in the javascript engine.}
\end{center}



\chapter{Graphical User Interface}

This chapter gives an overview over the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Colin.

\section{Workspace}
\label{sec:workspace}

Here a quick overview over the Workspace. This is the part of the GUI you are actually working with. The different parts are explained in depth later.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{itemize}

\section{Menubar}
\label{sec:menubar}
The menubar is placed on top of the Mainwindow on most operation systems. The \textit{file} menu contains some basic actions to organize, such as \textit{open} and \textit{save} (see figure~\ref{pic:filemenu}). The \textit{edit} menu contains some additional actions to manipulate the current file (see figure~\ref{pic:editmenu}) which are not present in the toolbar (see section~\ref{sec:toolbar}. You can activate these action by pressing the shortcut. It's visible next to the corresponding action.

\begin{minipage}[b]{\textwidth/2}

	\item \textit{settings}: launces the settings page.
\end{itemize}
\section{Tabbar}
\label{sec:tabbar}
This bar can be found on the buttom of the Colin GUI. You can see all open files and active them by clicking on them. Press the cross to close a tab. Press "+" to open a new tab.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/tabbar.png}
\caption{tabbar}
\label{pic:tabbar}
\end{figure}

\section{Toolbar}
\label{sec:toolbar}

The toolbar contains the most used actions. Icons with a triangle besides them are expandable. You can trigger a menu with more options by keeping the button pressed long. When moving the mouse over a icon a tooltip with some basic informations of the usage appears. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/toolbar.png}
\caption{toolbar}
\label{pic:toolbar}
\end{figure}

Here the actions in the toolbar from left to right.
\subsection{Nodes}
\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/nodetoolbar.png}
\caption{Nodes}
\label{pic:nodetoolbar}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can draw Nodes by clicking on the designated position in the GraphicsView. When you click on a beam, the beam gets spitted at the clicked position, when clicking on 2 crossing beams, the get both splitted and connected with a new node.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Beams}
\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/beamtoolbar.png}
\caption{Beams}
\label{pic:beamtoolbar}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can draw Beams, by clicking on the designated nodes in the GraphicView. If you do not click on a node, a new node will be created. Material and cross section are chosen automatically. You can set the material and cross section of beams created like this in the library widget (see section~\ref{ssec:library}). You can edit them afterwards too. This is shown in section~\ref{sec:graphical} (by using the GraphicView) and in section~\ref{ssec:tree} (by using the tree representation).
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Supports}
\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../pictures/support_opt.png}
\caption{options}
\label{pic:support_opt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated, you can add supports to nodes by clicking on the in the GraphicsView. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more settings. The buttons as shown in figure~\ref{pic:support_opt} appear. Here you can set the basic form of the support which gets added to a nodes by clicking on them:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingH.png} horizontal support: the horizontal displacement will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearing.png} vertical support: the vertical displacement of the node will be zero
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingM.png} rotational support: the rotation of the node will be zero
\end{trivlist}
You can choose any combination of these 3 basic supports. To use springs as supports and for rotated supports see section~\ref{ssec:tree} (editing in tree representation) or section~\ref{sec:nodedetail} (edit in detail view).
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Hinges}

\begin{minipage}[h]{4cm}

\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-4cm}
When activated you can add loads to the structure. Most of the actions here need two clicks to create a load. Figure~\ref{pic:drawload} shows the two required clicks for an uniformly distributed load. Keep the button pressed to get access to more settings. The possible types of loads:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} nodal lode. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/moment.png} moment. Click on a node in the GraphicsView to specify the position of the moment. The second click sets the value $M$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ustload.png} uniformly distributed load. Click on a beam to specify the position of the load. The second click sets the values $P_x$ and $P_z$ of the load and completes the input.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/istload.png} increasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/dstload.png} decreasing linear load. just like the uniformly distributed load.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/temp.png} temperature load. Click on a beam to specify the designated position of the temperature load. The widget as shown in figure~\ref{pic:tempwidget} in form of a thermometer appears. You can switch between temperature change and temperature difference (between top and bottom of the cross section) by clicking the button besides the thermometer or pressing the left and right keys ($\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$) on your keyboard. You can set the temperature difference by clicking on the thermometer (the scale is adapted automatically) or with the up and down keys ($\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$) of your keyboard. \textbf{Complete the input with the \textit{Enter} key.}

This button offers some options for the snap function of the GraphicsView (see section~\ref{sec:graphical}). You should know snap from other CAD applications. The snap tool can be enabled or disabled with a short click. For some actions, for which the snap function is required as adding supports or loads to the structure, the snap is always active. Keep the mouse button pressed to get access to more options. You can enable and disable specific snap functions by clicking on the related button.
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} Grid: If near the grid, the mouse gets snaped an moved to the grid. Also, when drawing a load or a beam with actived grid snap, the snap helps to enter beams with rounded lengths and rounded loads.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} Node: Snap nodes while drawing beams. This option must be on to connect existing nodes. When turned of, a click near a node will create a new node.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/crossing.png}Intersecting beams: When active, you will be able to snap the intersection of two beams. This allows to draw nodes in the position where the beams are intersecting. The intersecting beams will be connected to the new node when you do so.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/middle.png} Middle of beams: When active, the snap helps you to split beams in two sections with the same length while drawing nodes or beams. Also node loads can be put on beams (a new node is created automatically). With this option the middle of a beam is prefered.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/beam.png} Beams: While drawing nodes or beams, positions on beams are prefered. The beam snaped is connected to created nodes.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ortho_g.png} Global orthogonal: When enabled, the snap helps you to draw horizontal and vertical beams and loads.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ortho_l.png} Local orthogonal: When activated, the snap helps you to draw beams normal or parallel to existing beams. While drawing loads, the snap helps you to draw loads normal or parallel to the beam where the load is put on.
	\item[] \textbf{[range]}: The slider on the right side of the buttons can be used to adjust the range which the snap interprets as "near".

The four rectangles in this menu can be used to chose the visilbe GraphicViews. The GraphicViews are explaned in depth in section~\ref{sec:graphical}. You can click on a single rectangle to show the related GraphicsView. The currently visilbe GraphicViews are highlighted as the GraphicsView on the button left in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2}. The notations whitin the rectangles shows the data visulized in the related GraphicsView. You can also select more of them as shown in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2}. To do so, click on a Point in the area. A rectangle appears. Keep the mouse pressed and move the mouse until the rectanlge covers all GraphicViews you want to be shown. After releasing the mousebutton, a selection as in figure~\ref{pic:windowtoolbar2} would show the two GraphicsViews on the top. 
\end{minipage}


\section{Figure View}
\label{sec:graphical}

This is the central widget of \Colin. Most stuff can be created and edited here in a graphical mode. Also, you can right click most elements to get a detailed view and edit your file in detail. There can be up to four figures shown at the same time. You can set the results and details of the structure visualized there for each separated. You can also set the visualized combined load sets for all figures together.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/figure_main.png}
\caption{figures}
\label{pic:figure_main}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Beside your current structure, this view will show some widgets:

\paragraph{active CLS} Here you can chose the combined load sets, of which the results are shown in the figures and detailed views. Click on an active CLS to turn it off and vise versa. This widget will show a maximum of 3 sets and only the active ones. When moving the mouse over the widget, it will be expanded and show all combined load sets to chose from.

\paragraph{active elements} You can use this widget to chose the visualized type of results (normal force, shear force, moment and figure in the displaced configuration) and the visualized elements (loads, hinges, etc. ) of the structure. This widget will only show the type of results currently shown. To show hidden types of data or elements put your mouse cursor over the widget. The expanded widget is shown in figure~\ref{pic:activeelements}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{../pictures/activeelements.png}
\caption{active elements}
\label{pic:activeelements}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The four symbols in the first row represent the type of results to show:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{u}: the structure in displaced configuration.
	\item[]\textbf{\textcolor{green}{N}}: normal force.
	\item[]\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Q}}: shear force.
	\item[]\textbf{\textcolor{red}{M}}: moment.
\end{trivlist}
The four symbols in the second row represent some additional elements:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} \textbf{nodes}: show odes in displaced configuration
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} \textbf{loads}: show loads in the figure
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingHV.png} \textbf{reaction forces}: show reaction forces
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/joint.png} \textbf{hinges}: show hinges on beams
\end{trivlist}


\paragraph{window arrangement} In the upper right corner of every figure you will find some of those widgets, depending on the current layout of figures:
\begin{trivlist}
\leftskip=1cm
\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/windows.png} \textbf{show all}: A click on this symbol will show all four viewports beside each other. If this icon is visible, you can press the \textbf{space} key to trigger it's function.
\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/zoom_all.png} \textbf{show this}: A click on this symbol will hide all figures but this. If this icon is visible, you can press the \textbf{space} key to trigger it's function.
\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/close.png} \textbf{hide this}: A click on this symbol will hide this figure. The still visible figures will take it's place.
\end{trivlist}


\subsection{Navigation}

\paragraph{navigation tools}
The navigation includes a lot of tools. Here in short the tools to navigate in figures. For a detailed view you should check out section~\ref{sec:toolbar}
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/move.png}: Move the viewports (section~\ref{ssec:toolmove})
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/zoom_all.png}: Autoscale (section~\ref{ssec:toolscale})
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/zoom_rect.png}: Zoom rect, zoom in and zoom out (section~\ref{ssec:toolzoom})
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{use the mouse wheel} You can use the mouse wheel anytime (no matter which tool is currently selected) to change all kind of zoom factors. Using the mouse wheel without any modifiers will change the overall zoom. Using modifiers will modify zoom factors of loads, and results. The basic settings are as follows:
\begin{trivlist}
	\item[]\textbf{Mousewheel + Ctrl}: Zoom forces, this includes loads, normal forces, shear forces and reaction forces.
	\item[]\textbf{Mousewheel + Shift}: Zoom deformations.
	\item[]\textbf{Mousewheel + Alt}: Zoom moments, this includes loads, moments in beams and reaction forces.
\end{trivlist}
These modifiers can be set by the user in the settings. See also section~\ref{ssec:miscsettings}.

\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{\Colin will alway zoom around the current position of the mouse cursor. This means you can also move the viewport without selecting the move tool by repeatedly zooming in and out moving the mouse cursor.}
\end{center}

\paragraph{use the keyboard}
You can also use the keyboard to navigate trough the graphical representation of your structure. Beside the shortcuts for navigation actions such as \textit{zoom in} (Ctrl++ in standardsettings), \textit{zoom out} (Ctrl+-) and \textit{zoom all} (Ctrl+E) some other keys have a functionality:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{up arrow}: move the current point of view upwards
	\item[]\textbf{down arrow}: move the current point of view downwards
	\item[]\textbf{left arrow}: move the current point of view leftwards
	\item[]\textbf{right arrow}: move the current point of view rightwards
	\item[]\textbf{Enter}: Fit the current structure into all views
	\item[]\textbf{Space}: Switch between showing all and showing one figure
\end{trivlist}
Keys will always affect the currently highlighted view. You can identify it by it's colored boundary.

\subsection{Move}
Here a detailed view on the move tool (see also section ~\ref{ssec:toolmove}). This is the standard tool. Aborting other actions (pressing \textbf{Escape}) will always lead to an activation of this tool. Because of this and the high relation to the graphical interaction, particular attention to this tool is given in this chapter.\\
To move something, press the mouse above the item and move the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed. Depending on what you clicked an item is moved or also changed:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} \textbf{background}: If you clicked the background, you will move the current point of view.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} \textbf{nodes}: Change position of the node. 
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} \textbf{loads}: If you press the move button above a load, you can move it to another beam or node, depending on it's type. Also, some loads got a circle on their end, as shown in figure~\ref{pic:nloadbubble} for nodal loads and figure~\ref{pic:sloadbubble} for distributed loads.
\end{trivlist}

\label{pic:sloadbubble}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}


\subsection{Tooltips and Hovereffekts}

The tooltips are very usefull while drawing items. These tooltips tell you if the snap has found an object (to connect beams to already existing beams for example), a point in the grid (grid snap) or an angle orthogonal to an existing object (to draw loads normal to beams for example). The found object will also be highlighted. The tooltip contains also the index of the object found which help to identify items.\\
If you are using load sets, moving your mouse over a function will highlight it in the current figure. All other functions related to the same CLS as the highlighted function get highlighted in all other views. Also reaction forces will only be visible if your mouse touches an function. \textbf{All loads will be shown scaled such as set CLS.} The tooltip will show you the CLS which lead to this forces. Figure~\ref{pic:clshighlighted} shows the highlighted functions, the scaled loads, the reaction forces and the tooltip. See figure~\ref{pic:figure_main} for a normal view on the same file.


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}

\caption{Function highlighting, reaction forces and "real" loads}
\label{pic:clshighlighted}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Right Click Widgets}
\label{sec:rightclickwidgets}

A right click will show you a widget with more information about the item clicked. Depending on the item clicked, one of the following widgets will appear:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/grid.png} \textbf{background}: A widget for overall inforamtion, see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} \textbf{nodes}: The widget for nodes, see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/beam.png} \textbf{beams}: The widget for beams, see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}.
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} \textbf{loads}: The widget for loadss, see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}.
	
\end{trivlist}



These widgets are all organised in toolboxes. You can hide and show most of the toolboxes of these widgets by clicking on the corresponding checkbox in the top right of the toolbox. Some very important sections will always be shown and are not hideable.\\
All widgets can be closed pressing the \textif{Escape} key or pressing the red cross in the upper right corner of the widget. \\
Those widgets, which are related to a specific element of the structure, contain 3 buttons as shown in figure~\ref{pic:overlayheader}. Press "\textit{<}" or "\textit{>}" to switch to another element (of the same type). The number and icon in the middle marks the currently shown item.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/overlayheader.png}
\caption{header item of a right click widget}
\label{pic:overlayheader}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

You can still use the mouse wheel together with the modifiers \textit{Alt}, \texit{Strg} and \textit{Shift} to change the zoom factors of the underlying widget. This affects also the visualization of figures such as the detailed view on nodes and beams Using the moue wheel without any modifier will not affect the underlying widget.


\subsection{Structure proerties}
\label{sec:structdetail}


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/generaloverlay.png}
\caption{structure properties}
}
\label{pic:generaloverlay}
\end{figure}

This view appears after a \textbf{right click} on the background of the view widget. It shows some basic overall information. 

\paragraph{paste}
This element (placed on the left side of the screen, see also figure~\ref{pic:generaloverlay}) shows an overview over all parts which have been copied by any instance of \Colin. This can be nodes (with the corresponding support), beams (with the corresponding nodes and their properties), loads (including their basic load set) or many items. You can remove them from the temporary memory by clicking on the red cross in the upper right corner of the preview. You can insert them to your current file by clicking on the preview. This view will disappear immediately to allow you to specify the position where the copied elements should be insert. Click on the designated position to finish the procedure. The copied parts are now part of your current file. 

\paragraph{export}
This element (placed in the middle of the screen, see also figure~\ref{pic:generaloverlay}) allows you to export a picture of your current view on the structure. The picture contains the same elements and functions as the view you picked to launch this menu. The zoomfactor of all loads and functions matches also to those in the viewports.
The picture on top shows a preview of the exported file. Below, you can set some properties to make sure the picture matched to your needs:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{left}: The left boundary of the rectangle which is exported in global coordinates (meters).
	\item[]\textbf{right}: The right boundary of the rectangle which is exported in global coordinates (meters).
	\item[]\textbf{top}: The top boundary of the rectangle which is exported in global coordinates (meters).

\subsection{Detail/Edit View for nodes}
\label{sec:nodedetail}



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/nodeoverlay.png}
\caption{structure properties}
\label{pic:generaloverlay}
}
\end{figure}

This view appears after a \textbf{right click} on a node. It shows all properties of the node and allows edition (left row). Also, this view offers a detailed view to results for this node (center and right row).

\paragraph{coordinates}
Set the coordinates of the node:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{x}: horizontal coordinate of the node in meters
	\item[]\textbf{z}: vertical coordinate of the node in meters
	\item[]\textbf{phi}: the angle of the local coordinate system of the node. Editing is disabled if no support is set for this node. The local coordinate system affects only nodes with supports. Counterclockwise angles are positive!
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{support}
The first three buttons allow to set the support for this note:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingH.png} Horizontal support: toggle to set/remove
	\item[]\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingV.png} Vertical support: toggle to set/remove
	\item[]\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearingM.png} Moment support: toggle to set/remove
\end{trivlist}





\begin{minipage}[h]{6.5cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{../pictures/supportextended.png}
\caption{setting springs}
\label{pic:supportextended}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-7cm}
You can also set springs by checking the \textif{springs} ckeckbox. An extended toolbox as in figure~\ref{pic:supportextended} appears. To add a spring to your node, press the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} button next to the designated direction. The textbox next to the button will be activated and allow entering of a spring constant. The unit is shown at the end of the row (it can be set in the settings part, see also section~\ref{ssec:miscsettings}) 
\end{minipage}


\paragraph{clipboard}
Use the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} \textit{copy} or \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/spring.png} \textit{cut} button to copy the current node to the clipboard. The support gets copied too. Therefore, this feature can be used to assign supports very quickly to your nodes.

\paragraph{view}
Shows a detailed view on the current node. Colors are the same as in the viewport. Beside reaction forces, the graphic shows all forces in beams connected to this node. If you are using load set and combined load sets, the same CLS as in the viewport are shown here.

\paragraph{displacement}
Shows the displacement of the node. If you are using load sets and the value is the zero for all load sets, only one value is shown (labeled with $_{\max}$). Otherwise, all values are shown, below the maximum absolute value (labeled with $_{\max}$).
\textbf{You can select this text and copy it to your clipboard!} The index in the notation is the index of the CLS which leads to the respective displacement (for example, $u_{\max} = \text{absolute maximum of horizontal displacement}$, $u_{i} = \text{horizontal displacement of CLS i}$).

\paragraph{reactions}
Shows the reaction forces of the node. As for the displacement, the absolute maximum is shown on the top. Also, only one value is shown if all reaction forces of this direction are zero. They will not be listed if there is no support for the respective degree of freedom. Of course, this text can be copied to clipboard too.

\paragraph{beam forces}
Lists the forces in all beams connected to the note at the position where it is connected to the note. Only minimal and maximum value are shown if you are using CLS. Can also be copied.

\subsection{Detail/Edit View for beams}
\label{sec:beamdetail}



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../pictures/beamoverlay.png}
\caption{structure properties}
\label{pic:beamoverlay}
}
\end{figure}

This view appears after a \textbf{right click} on a beam. It shows all properties of the beam and allows edition (left row). Also, this view offers a detailed view to results for this beam (center and right row).

\paragraph{nodes}
Here you can view and set the nodes which define the geometry of the beam:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{from}: The left node of the beam
	\item[]\textbf{to}: The right node of the beam
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{geometry}
Shows additional geometry information, calculated by the application:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{alpha}: the angle between the beam and the global x axis. Counterclockwise angles are positive!
	\item[]\textbf{length}: the length of the beam
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{hinges}
The two basic buttons allow to add ordinary hinges (setting the moment at the designated position to zero), left button for a hinge between left end of the beam and the left node, the right button for a hinge between right end of the bean and the right node.\\
\begin{minipage}[h]{6.5cm}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{extended hinge options}
\label{pic:hingesextended}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth-7cm}
You can toogle the \textit{more...} checkbox to get access to a much more features as shown in figure~\ref{pic:hingesextended}. In addition to the basic option, this toolbox offers the posibility to add hinges for all degree of freedoms and springs for all hinges! This toolbox contains six rows. Every row represents one degree of freedom in the following order: $u_l$, $w_l$, $\varphi_l$, $u_r$, $w_r$, $\varphi_r$. Springs can be set the same way as for supports (see section~\ref{sec:nodedetail}).
\end{minipage}


\paragraph{properties}
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[]\textbf{material}: the material assigned to this beam

\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{clipboard}
Use the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/copy.png} \textit{copy} or \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/cut.png} \textit{cut} button to copy the current beam to the clipboard. Nodes and hinges related to this beam are copied too.

\paragraph{view}

This box offers a detailed view on the beam and all related forces. You can chose between two views: 

\begin{trivlist}
\leftskip=1cm
\item[] \textbf{extern}: Visualizes all extern forces, see figure~\ref{pic:externforces}. Beneath all distributed loads, this contains also the forces at the ends of the beam. If you are using load sets and combined load sets, all active load sets are shown together. 
\item[] \textbf{intern}: Visualizes all intern forces at a specific position. You can set this position by using the small box in the upper left corner of the picture. You can enter a value between zero and the beamlength. The beam will appear cutted at this position in the picture.
\end{trivlist}




\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-0.5cm}

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}

\textbf{note:}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Switching between the visualization of extern an intern forces and changing the position for which the results are shown will also lead to different information shown in other toolboxes. This affects the boxes for displacement and beam forces.}
\end{center}


\paragraph{functions}
Shows results such as displacement or forces for the current beam as functions.\\

\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-0.5cm}

\end{minipage}
\hspace{1cm}
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-0.5cm}
This toolbox shows normal force, shear force, moment, displacement and rotation in form of an analytical function, depending on $x$, where $x$ is the position in local beam coordinates. All functions shown are valid for the current beam. The index shows the combined load sets to which the results match (only when you are using load sets, otherwise no indexes will be there). All text can be selected and copied to clipboard. The unit in which results appear in this widget can be changed in the settings as well as the precision of numeric values.
\end{minipage}




\paragraph{displacement}
Depending on the selected mode (see view toolbox) one of the following will be listed here:
\begin{trivlist}
\leftskip=1cm
\item[] \textbf{extern}: Shows the displacement and rotation in the local coordinate system of the beam for each CLS. The minimum and maximum value for the property are shown bold and marked with $\min$ and $\max$ respectively.
\item[] \textbf{intern}: Shows the displacement and rotation at a specific position. The position matches to those set for the view.
\end{trivlist}

\end{trivlist}




\subsection{Detail/Edit View for loads}
\label{sec:loaddetail}

This view can be used for detailed view and editing of loads. It appears after right clicking a load (in a figure or in a list). This view will be slightly different for different groups of load types. They will look like this:

\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-0.5cm}

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-0.5cm}

\end{minipage}



The following parameters can be changed here:

\paragraph{position} Contains only the position where the load is placed on. It is actually the index of a node for moments and nodal loads, or the index of a beam for distributed loads, temperature loads and double loads.

\paragraph{type} This section is useful to change the type of loads. As in the tree representation this is limited to changes within groups:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \textbf{distributed loads}: Change between all forms of distributed loads.
	\item[] \textbf{temperature loads}: Change between temperature changes and temperature differences.
	\item[] \textbf{double loads}: Chose the position at the beam, left or right side
\end{trivlist}
The type of nodal loads and moments can not be changed.
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{loads} This toolbox contains all values for the load. Different for each type of load:
\begin{trivlist}
	\leftskip=1cm
	\item[] \textbf{nodal loads}:

			\leftskip=2cm
			\item[] $T$ : the temperature change or the temperature difference
		\end{trivlist}
\end{trivlist}

\paragraph{load set} Contains the set, which this load is assigned to. Click the combobox to get and select the desired set there.

\paragraph{clipboard}
Use the \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/copy.png} \textit{copy} or \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../icons/cut.png} \textit{cut} button to copy the current load to the clipboard. No beam or node related to this load will be copied within. When pasting you can select the new position (beam or node) by clicking it in one of the figures. The set which contains this load will be copied as well. When pasting this load, the set will be added to the structure, unless it contains a set with the same name.

	\item[] \textbf{Esc}: Abort editing
\end{trivlist}


All values can also be edited by clicking on them and entering the designated value.\\

\paragraph{Organization}

The tree contains 5 top level entries. All of them can be expanded to show their respective items. Some underlying entries can by expanded as well by clicking on the triangle on the left side.\\

Some entries are also marked with a green plus. This indicated that this entry can be used to add new items to the structure.


\begin{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/node.png} \textbf{nodes}: Contains all nodes. Each row shows one node, the last row shows a void entry which can be used to add nodes to the structure. A new node is added to the structure, when the coordinates have been set. All other properties can be set afterwards. Each column shows on the following properties:
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[]\textbf{x}: shows the x coordinate of the node
		\item[]\textbf{z}: shows the z coordinate of the node
		\item[]\textbf{phi}: shows the angle of the local coordinate system of the node. A node has only a local coordinate system if a support is set for the node.
	\end{trivlist}
	node entrys can be expanded to show: 
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bearing.png} \textbf{supports}: Each column shows one of the following:
		\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=2cm
		\item[]\textbf{x}: shows the support of the node in x direction. This value can be \textit{free} or \textit{locked}. Also, you can add a numeric value to force \colin to add a spring as support to this node. The sprin constand will be the entered value.
		\item[]\textbf{z}: shows the support of the node in y direction. Same usage as for x direction.
		\item[]\textbf{phi}: shows the support of the node against rotation. Same usage as for x direction.
		\end{trivlist}
	\end{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/beam.png} \textbf{beams}: Contains all beams. Each row shows one beam, the last row shows a void entry which can be used to add beams. A new beam is added to the structure, when the nodes which define it's geometry have been set. All other properties can be set afterwards. Each column shows one of the following properties:
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm		
		\item[]\textbf{from}: the left node of the beam
		\item[]\textbf{to}: the right node of the beam
		\item[]\textbf{material}: the material of the beam. Can be chosen in a list when clicking on the parameter

		\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=2cm
		\item[] \textbf{x}: The hinge parallel to the beam axis (the local x axis). Entries can be set the same way as for supports: \textit{free} marks a hinge (normal force will be 0), while \textit{locked} marks a connection (the displacement between node an beam end will be 0)to the respective node. Entering a numeric value leads to a spring between node and beam in the structure.
		\item[] \textbf{z}: The hinge normal to the beam axis (the local z axis). Usage as for x direction: \textit{free} for a hinge (shear force will be 0), \textit{locked} for a direct connection and a numeric value to add a spring.
		\item[] \textbf{phi}: An ordinary hinge. \textit{free} to mark a hinge (moment will be 0), \textit{locked} for a torsionally stiff connection or a numeric value for a spring.
		\end{trivlist}

		\item[] nodal loads: \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} and \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/moment.png}
		\end{trivlist}
		While using the last entry to add a load to your structure, you can switch between all types!
		\item[] \textbf{position}: The beam (for \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/dstload.png}, \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/istload.png}, \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/ustload.png}, \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/tempDiff.png}, \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/tempChange.png}, \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/doubleL.png})or node (for \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/load.png} and \includegraphics[scale = 0This is the only value for the moment. Also, this row might represent the .5]{../../icons/moment.png}) where the load is placed on.
		\item[] \textbf{x}: The horizontal value of the load. It represents the temperature change for temperature changes and the load in global x direction for all other loads. The unit shown can be changed in the settings (see section~\ref{ssec:miscsettings}).
		\item[] \textbf{z}: The vertical value of the load. It represents the temperature difference between upper and lower part of a beam or the load in global z direction for all loads. Unit as x direction.
		\item[] \textbf{phi}: The value which leads to rotation. This is the only value for the moment. 
		\item[] \textbf{set}: Loads can be grouped to sets. This row can be used to do so. Click on the current value to get access to a list of possible values. You can also chose \textit{none}. Please note that if you do so, the load will not be considered during calculation when calculating combinations of load sets.
		\end{trivlist}
	\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bls.png} \textbf{loadsets}: Contains all loadsets. Each row shows one load set, the last row can again be used to add loads set. A single load set item contains following parameters:
	\begin{trivlist}

	All CLS items can be expanded to show the combination of load sets they consist of:
	\begin{trivlist}
		\leftskip=1cm
		\item[] \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{../../icons/bls.png} \textbf{parts of CLS}: Each of them represents a BLS added to this CLS, one per row. Data in columns shows one of the following:
		\begin{trivlist}
			\leftskip=2cm
			\item[]\textbf{name}: the name of the BLS added to this CLS. After a click on a name, a list with all BLS appers. Select one of them to replace the BLS. Select \textit{delete} to remove this entry from your combination. Also a right click on an item enables you to remove the BLS from the combination.
			\item[]\textbf{active/factor}: All loads of the BLS are multiplied with the factor when calculating forces in the structure.
		\end{trivlist}
		To add a BLS to the combination, use the last row, marked with a green plus. Once you entered a name, the load set is added with factor one to the combination. Of course this factor can be changed afterwards. If you enter a name witch already exists, a number is appended to the name.

At the top you can also find a switch. You can chose weather additional menus are triggered by a long mouse press or a button right beside the tool button. Figure~\ref{pic:menusintool} shows no extra menu button (initial setting), figure~\ref{pic:menusbesidetool} shows extra buttons to trigger additional menus.

\section{Backup your Settings}

For some people it might be interesting to backup their settings and probably restore them on an other PC. You can restore the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item snapsettings
	\item shortcuts
	\item window geometry
	\item library
	\item console history
	\item print settings
	\item colors 
	\item view settings 
	\item modifiers for mousewheel
	\item draw settings
	\item unitsettings
	\item recently used files
	\item path to wallpaper
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Linux}

You can find your settings in \texttt{$\sim$/.config/clazzes.org/Colin.conf}\footnote{/$\sim$ is your home directory (\texttt{/home/user})!}. Save this file and restore it in the same folder.

\subsection{Windows}



\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth-1.5cm}

\caption{backup in registry editor}
\label{pic:regedit}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[h]{0.5\textwidth+0.5cm}
\Colin writes it's settings to the Windows registry. You will need \textit{regedit}, the Windows registry editor to backup your files. To get into \textit{regedit} search for \texttt{regedit} in the Windows 7 startermenu. On Windows XP select \textit{Run...} in the startmenu. Enter \texttt{regedit} there and launch it.\\
Now safe all keyes for \begin{center}{\texttt{HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER/Software/clazzes.org/Colin}\end{center}\\
by right clicking the folder and selection \textit{Export...} as shown in figure~\ref{pic:regedit}. Chose a filename and save it. To restore, double click the saved file and add all keys to the registry.

\chapter{Valgrind hints}
\label{cha:valgrind}
Valgrind is memory check tool and threading check tool for Unix. It detects memory leaks, uninitialized memory, corrupt reads and writes on memory, running conditions, dead locks etc.\footnote{\url{http://valgrind.org/}}\\
You should find a valgrind package in your distributors repository. On a Debian based Linux you can install it by typing the following in a terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
sudo apt-get install valgrind
\end{lstlisting}

You than can run valgrind as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

To remove warnings detected in libraries such as Qt, add suppression files to the valgrind parameters. The valgrind folder in the SVN repository contains a bash script to download the supression file for the gnome environment. Run the following in the valgrind folder to get it:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
./get_supp.sh
\end{lstlisting}

Run valgrind afterwards as follows in the Debug folder:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, breaklines=true, basicstyle=\small]
valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=../valgrind/libh3dtoolkit.supp ./Colin -graphicssystem raster
\end{lstlisting}

You can add warnings to the supression file if you are sure they do not affect the correct execution application.
